== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I enable storing other languages in database when upgrading from v1.0.7? (fresh install of v1.0.8 onwards already support utf8mb4)=
* Backup your database (just in case)
* rename myi-inventory/assets/delete_tables.sql to myi-inventory/assets/delete_tables_prod.sql  
* rename myi-inventory/assets/convert_utf8.sql to myi-inventory/assets/delete_tables.sql

= How do I change the default client_cd? =

To change the default client_cd, go to myi-inventory/assets/setup_tables.sql and modify the statement   

INSERT INTO `@wp_@myi_mst_client` (`client_id`, `client_cd`, `client_name`, `client_remark`, `deleted`, `create_date`, `create_by_id`, `last_mod_date`, `last_mod_by_id`, `delete_date`, `delete_by_id`) 
VALUES (NULL, 'Default', 'Default', NULL, 0, now(), @cur_user_id@, now(), @cur_user_id@, NULL, NULL);  
  
to  
  
INSERT INTO `@wp_@myi_mst_client` (`client_id`, `client_cd`, `client_name`, `client_remark`, `deleted`, `create_date`, `create_by_id`, `last_mod_date`, `last_mod_by_id`, `delete_date`, `delete_by_id`) 
VALUES (NULL, 'Name I want', 'Default', NULL, 0, now(), @cur_user_id@, now(), @cur_user_id@, NULL, NULL);  
  
then rename myi-inventory/assets/delete_tables.sql to myi-inventory/assets/delete_tables_prod.sql  
followed by rename myi-inventory/assets/delete_tables_dev.sql to myi-inventory/assets/delete_tables.sql  
  
Deactivate the plugin and then reactivate it.  
  
Followed by the below to revert back (in case accidentally click on deactivate and all tables deleted)  
  
rename myi-inventory/assets/delete_tables.sql to myi-inventory/assets/delete_tables_dev.sql  
rename myi-inventory/assets/delete_tables_prod.sql to myi-inventory/assets/delete_tables.sql  
  
= How do I get my theme css to take precedence over the css of the plugin? = 

For any themes css to take precedence over the plugin, set the priority of the theme to higher than 99999.  
eg.   
// set priority to 999999 so that will load after plugin  
`add_action( 'wp_enqueue_scripts', 'my_theme_enqueue_styles',999999 );  
if ( ! function_exists( 'my_theme_enqueue_styles' ) ) {  
	function my_theme_enqueue_styles() {  
    		wp_enqueue_style( 'parent-style', get_template_directory_uri() . '/style.css' );  
    		wp_enqueue_style( 'parent-style', get_template_directory_uri() . '/style-rtl.css' );  
  
		    $parent_style = 'parent-style';  
  
    		wp_enqueue_style( $parent_style, get_template_directory_uri() . '/style.css' );  
    		wp_enqueue_style( 'child-style',  
        		get_stylesheet_directory_uri() . '/style.css',  
        		array( $parent_style )  
    		);  
	}  
}`  

= Can I transfer the same products into different packings? = 

So long as it is the same product with the same smallest UOM, you can transfer between each other.

Eg. Product A have the below UOM Sets.   

 (1.)  Box <- (X50) <- Packages  
   
 (2.)  Box <- (X100) <- Packages   
   
 (3.)  Box <- (X1000) <- Pieces   
  
You can transfer between (1.) and (2.) as both have the same smallest UOM (Packages).  
However, you can't do it for (3.)  
In order to transfer from (1.) to (3.), you need to add in the number of pieces per package for (1.)  
  
= Why can't I delete the product/UOM/Category etc? = 

Ensure that there are no longer any inventory for that product.   
Ensure that the product/UOM/Category is no longer in use. (also not set in Prod UOM Setup).   

= Hey!!! Some codes in this plugin belongs to me =

I try to give proper credit to all the Authors of my codes.   
However, at times (especially when rushing dateline), I might have forgotten to give you proper credit.   
  
Please forgive me and drop me an email at [ng.kock.leong@elinemm.com](mailto:ng.kock.leong@elinemm.com) indicating the function name and the author name.  
I will add into the codes the proper author of the function.

= Who is the photographer for the plugin header (the warehouse photo)? =

The photo belongs to [Ronnieb](https://morguefile.com/creative/ronnieb).  
You can find the photo at [https://morguefile.com/search/morguefile/2/shelves/pop](https://morguefile.com/search/morguefile/2/shelves/pop).

= 1.0.7 =
* add in codes to create primary menu for current theme if it does not exists.

* add in handling of @ignore@ tag for sql files. This tag will not raise any error for this statement and if this statement fails, next statement will not raise any errors. Meant to be used for the CREATE TABLE command before the ALTER TABLE command. Needed so that reactivation will not raise error but first run will raise error if SQL failed.

= 1.0.4 =

* Change the function that process sql statement to treat ; followed by 4 line breaks to treat as new command as WP SVN will alter the sql files and insert additional linebreaks
